Introduction:
The purpose of this project is to develop a Online Food Ordering Application. It is an application that enables customers to place their order online at any time and place. Besides that it provides a user friendly web pages, and attractive graphics. The basic layout of the application is as follows. Initially the customer will have to select the Restaurant name from which he/she wants to order. Then, the Customer will have to select the Category of food he/she wants to order (Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner). Based on that the next page will show the corresponding items, from which the customer can chose which ever items he/she wants. Hence, the order is successfully placed. Once the order is placed, the customer will get the unique order id number. Which the user can enter to get the details of the food items placed.


Specifications:
1. Programming Languages used - Python
2. Scripting languages used - HTML
3. UI/UX Python library used - Flask
4. Backend used - Mysql


Steps to Install:
1. Install Python
	Install Python version 2.7
		https://www.python.org/downloads/
	In case, you have Python version 3 and above.
	You can execute the project using "conda environment"
	Use the below commands:
		(i) conda create -n zappos python=2.7 anaconda
			To create the conda environment
		(ii) source activate zappos
			To activate the conda environment

2. Install Flask:
	Install flask from command line:
		sudo pip install Flask
	In case, if that doesn't work and you don't have pip installed; then go through the following steps:
		http://www1.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/alee/cs40/penv/installFlaskOnMac.html

3. Install Mysql:
	Install mysql using command line:
		pip install Mysql-python
	If this doesn't work, then try: (assuming brew is installed already)
		brew install mysql
		sudo pip install MySQL-python


Once the installation is complete, we will create the directory structure required for flask:
1. Create a 'ZapposFoodApp' folder
	It will contain a 'templates', 'static' named folders and all the python files
2. Create a 'templates' folder inside 'ZapposFoodApp' folder
	It will contain all the HTML files
3. Create a 'static' folder inside 'ZapposFoodApp' folder
	It will contain all the images
4. Now insert files "index.html", "menu.html", "menuItems.html", "success.html" and "showOrder.html" in the 'templates' folder
5. And then insert files "index.jpg", "menu.jpg", "menuItems.jpeg", "success.gif" and "showOrder.png" in the 'templates' folder
6. Finally insert files "index_startApp.py", and "createdb.py" in the 'ZapposFoodApp' folder. 


Steps of execution of the project:
1. First open the command prompt and go to the directory location of 'ZapposFoodApp' folder.
	To verify: when you type 'ls'; it should contain all the python files and the template folder.
2. Execute this command to create and load the database tables. Please note that we are using MqSQL database.
	python createdb.py
2. Now execute this command:
	python index_startApp.py
3. Then, paste the URL " http://127.0.0.1:5002/ " in the browser to place the order.
4. Now place the order as per the available food items at various restaurants.
5. Once the order is placed, an Order ID is generated. With the help of Order ID the user can check the items he/she has placed.
6. You are all done!
