# Data-Science
It contains two home-works and one final project in the Data Science academic subject.

## Technologies Used:
#### Python Programming Language (3.* version):
  - Basic Libraries Used: ***numpy***, ***pandas***, ***sklearn***, ***matplotlib***, ***scipy***, ***random***
  - Advanced Libraries Used: ***folium***, ***networkx***, ***PageRank***
  - Tools Used: ***Jupyter notebook***, ***Pycharm***


## HomeWork 2
- Applied various models in order to understand the functioning of various models and their pros and cons.
- Implemented ***Pearson coefficient***, ***Heat Map***, ***Scatter plot***, ***Histogram***, ***line chart***, ***Linear regression***, ***K-nearest neighbour model***, and ***Random Forest***. 

## HomeWork 3
- I along with two of my classmates, participated in the Kaggle competition. The name of the competition was "Zillow's House Value Prediction".
- We were asked to predict the accuracy of their results.
- The dataset was about 3 million rows.
- Applied about 5-6 different models. Found that ***Lasso regression*** and ***Linear regression*** were giving the best predictions.
- Later, we researched a bit more. And found that, ***XGBoost*** model is the best one with the highest accuracy percentage.
- Hence, we submitted the final version of the project and were ranked in the top 50% of all the 3500+ participants.

## Project
- It was again a group project. I worked with two of my classmates on the project named "Railway Network Mapping and Analysis".
- There were ***three main objectives*** of the project:
  - Find the shortest distance between any given source and destination. 
    - For the implementation, we used ***"Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm"*** and modified a bit to get the best results.
  - Place 1000 sensor's across all the USA railway network map in order to monitor the maximum railway network traffic.
    - For the implementation, we used ***"Page Rank Algorithm"*** and ranked the stations.
  - The final objective was to create ***test cases*** and prove that the accracy of the application is more than 95%.
    - For this, we took several different paths, and display the total number of trains passing through station A to station B.
    - The accuracy of the project was around 96%.
- The professor, really liked the project and for my contribution, I received ***A-*** grade in the subject.
